## About The Project

This project automates the process of collecting property data from a website (specifically a Zillow clone) and filling out a Google Form with the gathered information. It comprises three Python files:


main.py: The main script that calls the other modules to initiate the process.
getpropertydata.py: Contains a class to scrape property data from the given website.
filloutform.py: Contains a class to fill out a Google Form with the retrieved data.

## Built With

Python 3.6 or later

requests: pip install requests

beautifulsoup4: pip install beautifulsoup4

selenium: pip install selenium

beautifulsoup4

smtplib

## Usage

- The script opens a Chrome browser window to fill out the form.

- Be mindful of scraping practices and terms of service for the websites involved.

- Consider error handling for potential exceptions during scraping or form filling.
